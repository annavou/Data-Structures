# Data Structures Project in C++
***

A team-working project for the "Data Structures" course at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

The main idea of the project is to calculate the frequency and the time that each structure neeeds to find all the Q words (Q is an array with random words) in the .txt file.
Each structure can implement the functions of insert, delete and search except of HashMap that does not support the function of delete.

The Data Structures that we developed are:
* Unsorted Array
* Sorted Array
* Binary Tree
* AVL Tree
* HashMap
